## üîç Experiment Steps

### 1. ADB Dump from DJI Drone

- Performed ADB dump on the DJI drone to extract required internal libraries and components.
- **Note:** All libraries and their invocation paths must be properly set for the binaries to run.

### 2. Emulating DJI Drone Environment on Raspberry Pi

- Used a **Raspberry Pi** to replicate a DJI-like environment running **Android 4.0**.
- ‚úÖ **Note:** DJI binaries require Android versions **below 5.0** to execute properly.

### 3. Cross-Compiling Android-AFL for Fuzzing

Used the following command to cross-compile [**android-afl**](https://github.com/ele7enxxh/android-afl):

```bash
arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc -march=armv5te -mfloat-abi=soft \
  -I/usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/include afl-fuzz.c -o afl-fuzz
